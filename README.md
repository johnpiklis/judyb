I work as a Customer Support Engineer and a virtual assistant specialist, with hands on in HPE and Huawei
servers, 3par storage, XP storage, and SAN switches. I have extensive experience in providing both on-site
and remote support. My expertise includes swiftly initiating a case for a malfunctioning device, gathering the
necessary logs for in-depth analysis for troubleshooting, tracking the estimated arrival time of replacement
parts, and ensuring the seamless delivery of hardware components to the site for installation during
scheduled maintenance windows. I excel in the process of replacing faulty hardware components. I can
schedule meeting and draft emails to resolve technical issues and guide customers on a specific project to
achieve outmost result using CRM tools like zendesk, Clickup, Hubspot etc.
